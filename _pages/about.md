<br> I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan—Ann Arbor, advised by [Prof. Xudong (Sherman) Fan](https://fanlab.bme.umich.edu/) and [Prof.Zhaohui Zhong](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/zhonglab/). 

My research focuses on creating high-performance analytical instruments for gas sensing, with an emphasis on hygrometer-based systems and micro gas chromatography (µGC). I strive to design compact, high-sensitivity gas analyzers that can transform applications in environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial safety. Fueled by a passion for multidisciplinary engineering, I bring together microsystems, analog and mixed-signal circuit design, chemical sensor technologies, and point-of-care diagnostics—pushing the boundaries of innovation to open new possibilities and deliver meaningful impact in science and society.

Previously, I conducted research at the [Shafiee Lab](https://shafieelab.bwh.harvard.edu/) under the guidance of Dr.Hadi Shafiee at Harvard Medical School - Brigham and Women's Hospital, where I extensively worked on low-cost smartphone-based point-of-care diagnostic devices for low-resource settings.

I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (IC and VLSI specialization) from the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor, and B.Tech in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from SASTRA University, India.
