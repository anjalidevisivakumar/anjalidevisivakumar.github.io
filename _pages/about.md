[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://anjalidevisivakumar.github.io/anjali.github.io/files/Resume_2024.pdf)

Hi! 
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michiganâ€”Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. Xudong (Sherman) Fan and Prof.Zhaohui Zhong. My research interests are MEMS, microsystems, and analog signal conditioning. My current research focuses on developing ultra-fast, multidimensional, low-power portable micro-gas chromatography systems for point-of-care applications.

Previously, I conducted research at the Shafiee Lab under the guidance of Dr.Hadi Shafiee at Harvard Medical School - Brigham and Women's Hospital, where I extensively worked on low-cost smartphone-based point-of-care diagnostic devices for low-resource settings.

I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (IC and VLSI specialization) from the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor, and B.Tech in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from SASTRA University, India.
