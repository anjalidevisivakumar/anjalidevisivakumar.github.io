<br> I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan—Ann Arbor, advised by [Prof. Xudong (Sherman) Fan](https://fanlab.bme.umich.edu/) and Prof.Zhaohui Zhong. 
<br>My research focuses on developing high-performance analytical instruments for gas sensing, with an emphasis on hygrometer-based systems and micro gas chromatography (µGC). I specialize in integrating MEMS components, low-power control electronics, and advanced signal processing techniques to enhance the sensitivity, selectivity, and portability of gas sensing platforms. My work aims to deliver compact, high-sensitivity gas analyzers for applications in environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial safety. My research interests include microsystems, analog and mixed-signal circuit design, chemical sensor technologies, and point-of-care diagnostics.

Previously, I conducted research at the Shafiee Lab under the guidance of Dr.Hadi Shafiee at Harvard Medical School - Brigham and Women's Hospital, where I extensively worked on low-cost smartphone-based point-of-care diagnostic devices for low-resource settings.

I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (IC and VLSI specialization) from the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor, and B.Tech in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from SASTRA University, India.
